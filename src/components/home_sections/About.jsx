        Hello World, Iâ€™m Cecilie Jasmin, a digital designer. <br></br>
        in 2020 I quit my studies in Architectural Technology and Construction
        Management when I found myself more interested in the design of the
        buildings. <br></br>
        The following year I took the chance and began studying multimedia
        design. This was where I found my passion in UX/UI and surprisingly,
        Frontend Development as well. <br></br>
        Since then I have gained 2 years of experience with a strong focus on
        creating accessible web solutions and engaging user experiences{" "}
