        Hello World, Iâ€™m Cecilie Jasmin, a digital designer. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In 2021 I took the chance and began studying multimedia design. This was
        where I found my passion in UX/UI and surprisingly, Frontend Development
        as well. Since then I have gained 2 years of experience with a strong
        focus on creating accessible web solutions and engaging user experiences{" "}
